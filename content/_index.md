## Motivating case studies

[Metropolitan collaborative surveillance](https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.2586)

* Discovery and integration of smart cameras
* Multiple video streams to be fused and synchronized
* Object detection, tracking, analysis
* Processing can be on cloud, on fog, on edge

See paper by Dautov et al.

## Motivating case studies

[360Â° view multiplayer gaming](https://doi.org/10.1109/FMEC.2017.7946410)

* Multi-view (see what others are seeing)
* Augmented or Virtual Reality: free movement
* Delay intolerance
* Excessive bandwidth usage

## Problem and forces

* **heterogeneity**: *asymmetry among device capabilities*
* **locality**: *information is more valuable when is close to its source, moving it is expensive*
* **hybrid coordination**: *information aggregation is required, full centralization brings unacceptable costs*
* **dinamicity** *environment, network, and system structure changes at runtime*

## Shared solution elements

1. *Election of leaders* -- from a set of candidates
2. *Formation of regions* -- by assigning each user to a single leader
3. *Upstream information flow* -- from users to leaders
4. *Downstream information flow* -- from leaders to users
